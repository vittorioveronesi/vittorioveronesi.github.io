                <h1 class = "title_project">My external hard drive is an artist.</h1>
                <p id = "about">I was in Urbino where I was studying for a university exam. 
                    Suddenly my external hard drive decided to crash and I lost all of my necessary exam files. 
                    I went to the nearest computer services to see if there was a possibility to get back my files. 
                    Luckily the computer technician gave me a new hard drive full of my holy exams after some hours of work 
                    and he said he retrieved my files but probably some of them were damaged. So, when I opened my folder, 
                    I found a lot of strange and original masterpieces that my hard drive decided to create. I found it amazing, 
                    like a sci-fi story where the chaos (if we can call it like that) becomes the decision-maker of amazing visual work. 
                    It is normal to be afraid of errors but sometimes they are a lesson for an easier life.

                    He also produced a portrait of Paul Verlaine.
